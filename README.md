This repository contains a collection of projects and exercises related to Image Processing, developed as part of the coursework for the Image Processing class in the Computer Science program. The projects focus on various techniques and algorithms used to analyze, enhance, and manipulate digital images.

Key Features:
Image Filtering: Implementation of spatial filters (low-pass, high-pass) and convolution operations.
Edge Detection: Techniques for identifying the boundaries within images using methods like Sobel, Prewitt, and Canny edge detectors.
Image Transformation: Application of geometric transformations, including scaling, rotation, and translation.
Color Processing: Conversion between different color spaces (e.g., RGB to Grayscale) and basic color enhancement techniques.
Fourier Transform: Analysis of images in the frequency domain using Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT).
Object Recognition: Basic methods for detecting and recognizing objects in images.
Technologies Used:
Python: The primary programming language used for implementing image processing algorithms.
OpenCV: A powerful open-source library for computer vision and image processing.
NumPy: Used for numerical operations and handling image matrices.
Matplotlib: For visualizing images and processing results.
